<p>The <strong>VIEW ALL</strong> button allows you to display all of the error and warning messages listed for each section of the application. You can go to a specific section by clicking on the section name. You can hide all of the error and warning messages for each section by clicking the <strong> HIDE ALL</strong> button.</p>
<p>The error and warning messages will no longer display once they have been corrected. Note that you may submit an application with warning messages, but you may not submit an application with error messages. When all of the errors have been corrected, the system shows a green checkmark with a "No errors" message for each section. You may then click the <strong> CONTINUE TO CERTIFY</strong> button to continue the application process.</p>
