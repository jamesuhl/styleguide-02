<p>The applicant's legal classification determines what information will be required on subsequent screens. For example, an applicant with a legal classification of "Individual" will be required to enter information that is different from the information that an applicant with a legal classification of "Corporation" or "Limited Liability Company" must enter.</p>
<p>You must select one classification type for the applicant from the list of legal classification choices on this page. If you select "Other" for the applicant's legal classification, a text box will open in which you must describe the applicant's legal classification. If you do not choose a legal classification, you will receive an error message and will be unable to continue to the next page of the application.</p>
